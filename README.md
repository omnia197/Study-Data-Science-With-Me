# Study Data Science With Me
Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that I have worked on in Data Analysis, Python, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. Each project represents a step in my journey to mastering these domains, solving real-world problems, and building practical applications. I have developed around 30 projects that range from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning models and computer vision solutions.

## Here's an overview of the types of projects you’ll find in this repository:
### 1. Python Projects
#### _ Ping Pong Game: 
This project is a simple Ping Pong Game implemented using Python and the Turtle graphics library. It’s a two-player game where each player controls a paddle, and the objective is to prevent the ball from going past the paddle. The game can be played in a local multiplayer setup, with players using different keys to move their paddles.

#### _ Hangman Game:
This project is a classic Hangman Game implemented in Python. The game involves guessing a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. If the player guesses too many incorrect letters, the game ends, and the player "hangs." This simple game demonstrates core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.

#### _ OOP:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize code into reusable, modular components. In Python, OOP is widely used to build efficient, readable, and maintainable programs. This file introduces the core OOP concepts: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, with Python examples.

#### _ Nobel Webscraping:
This project demonstrates how to use web scraping techniques to extract Nobel Prize data from Wikipedia. Using Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, we scrape details such as laureates, categories, years, and prize motivations from the relevant Wikipedia pages.

### 2. Data Analysis With Python
Data Analysis with Python Projects involve the systematic exploration, interpretation, and visualization of data using Python programming. These projects focus on many popular Python libraries to perform tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization: EDA Visualization, Handling Data, Netflix Analysis, Study performance, WHO-COVID-19-global.

### 3. Machine Learning

##### ML
This part showcases my work in Machine Learning with Python, where I apply various algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from data. The project demonstrates the entire workflow of a machine learning pipeline, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. Leveraging Python's extensive libraries, I aim to solve real-world problems through effective machine learning techniques.

##### Neural Network
Implement and explore of Neural Networks, a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are powerful tools for various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and more. This project aims to demonstrate the key concepts, architectures, and applications of neural networks using Python.

### 4. Computer Vision
This part focuses on Computer Vision, a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and process visual information from the world. Computer vision techniques are widely used in applications such as image and video recognition, autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and medical image analysis. This project demonstrates various concepts and techniques in computer vision using Python.
